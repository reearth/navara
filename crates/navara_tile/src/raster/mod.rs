/// (cache prune / memory eviction), or the globe tiling scheme flipped (which switches
/// between baked and direct drape slots). Camera movement alone does NOT bump
/// it — an existing terrain tile's resolve depends only on the loaded-fragment set, so
/// bumping every traverse made every visible tile re-resolve every frame during camera
/// motion (an FPS killer). The web renderer reads it once per frame and skips the
