// WASM linear memory only grows, so each worker's heap ratchets up to its
// peak decode working set and never returns memory to the OS. The only way
// to release it is to terminate the worker thread (the wasm-bindgen glue
// caches its instance and skips re-initialization within a worker), so this
// pool recycles worker threads.
//
// Each worker gets its own single-worker workerpool (a "slot") so it can be
// recycled independently at its own task boundaries: after each settled task
// the slot's actual heap size is probed ("getWasmMemoryUsage"); once it
// exceeds the budget the slot stops receiving new tasks, and as soon as its
// in-flight tasks drain it is terminated and replaced. This keeps memory
// bounded even under sustained load (no pool-wide idle moment is required)
// and never discards more than one warm WASM instance at a time. The
// trade-off versus a single shared queue is possible head-of-line blocking
// within a slot, but upstream backpressure (ConcurrencyManager) keeps
// per-slot queues shallow.
//
// A burst that stays under the heap budget would otherwise keep its heaps
// forever, so an idle sweep additionally recycles every used slot once the
// pool has been quiet for RECYCLE_IDLE_MS.
//
// Recycled slots are pre-warmed immediately with a fire-and-forget "warmUp"
// task so the next real task doesn't pay WASM initialization latency.
