/**
 * A drape resolver owns one family of composite material slots for a terrain
 * tile: how its layers' pixels reach those slots (direct texture binding or an
 * offscreen bake into per-layer render targets), gated so the work only runs
 * when the Rust-side resolve or the backing content actually changed.
 *
 * Three implementations, side by side, spell out the rendering differences:
 * - {@link VectorDrapeResolver} (`vectorDrapeResolver.ts`) — clamp-to-ground
 *   vector layers. Always baked on every tiling scheme (vector content is an
 *   offscreen scene, so rasterizing is intrinsic); WebMercator terrain is the
 *   degenerate single-source identity case, Geographic terrain the N:M mosaic.
 * - `DirectRasterDrapeResolver` (`rasterDrapeResolver.ts`) — raster layers on
 *   WebMercator terrain. Same-scheme 1:1: the fetched tile texture is bound
 *   straight to its slot by `setupTextures`; every hook is a no-op.
 * - `BakedRasterDrapeResolver` (`rasterDrapeResolver.ts`) — raster layers on
 *   Geographic (quantized-mesh) terrain. Cross-scheme N:M mosaic bake with
 *   per-slot Mercator latitude reprojection.
