 *
 * IMPORTANT: once released, the attribute can no longer be re-uploaded — a
 * WebGL context loss will NOT be able to restore it. Our geometry is
 * WASM-sourced and re-fetched on demand rather than re-uploaded, and the memory
 * ledger (`GPU_GEOMETRY_RESIDENCY_FACTOR`) now assumes exactly one resident
 * (GPU) copy, so this trade-off is intentional. Only apply it to attributes
 * whose `.array` is not re-read on the CPU after upload (bounding volumes must
 * already be computed/assigned; batch/feature-id arrays must be consumed at
 * setup time, not lazily).
