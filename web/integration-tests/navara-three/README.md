# @navara/three Integration Test

This project tests `@navara/three` from an end user's perspective, using the built library files instead of source files.

## What This Tests

- Library exports work correctly
- TypeScript type definitions are properly generated
- WASM modules load correctly
- Basic functionality (globe rendering, layers, camera) works

## Running

```bash
# Development mode (from repository root)
pnpm dev:integration

# Or from this directory
pnpm dev
```

## Building

```bash
# Production build (from repository root)
pnpm build:integration

# Or from this directory
pnpm build
```

## Example Code

The `src/main.ts` contains a minimal example that:

1. Creates a `ThreeView` instance
2. Initializes the WASM engine
3. Adds atmosphere and effect descriptors
4. Adds terrain and tile layers
5. Sets the camera position

This exercises the core functionality that users would typically use.
