# Writing Rules

Please follow these rules when you modify this repository.

## Prose style: no dash decorations, no semicolons

Do not decorate prose with em dashes, en dashes, or double hyphens (`—`, `–`, `--`), and do not join clauses with semicolons (`;`). Write full sentences instead, using commas, colons, parentheses, "because" / "for example", or by splitting into two sentences. This applies to both locales.

- Definition bullets and table description cells use a colon: `**Label**: description` (not `**Label** — description`).
- Two independent clauses become two sentences: "All fields are optional. An unset field keeps the default color." (not "All fields are optional; an unset field …").
- Property metadata lines are separate paragraphs, never joined on one line:

  ```markdown
  **Type:** `boolean | undefined`

  **Default:** `true`
  ```

- A table cell containing only `—` is a placeholder meaning "no default / not applicable". Keep those as-is.
- Ordinary hyphens in words (built-in, level-of-detail), markdown table separator rows, and code (semicolons included) are unaffected.

## Terminology

### "Layer" vs "Object" vs "Descriptor"

Mesh, effect, and light APIs were renamed from `*Layer` to `*Desc`. Use the following terms in documentation:

| Context | Term | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| The rendered thing itself (generic reference) | **object** | "Add a mesh object to the scene" |
| Configuration, class definition, or implementation | **Descriptor** | "Register a Descriptor class", "Can only be set at Descriptor creation time" |
| Resource layers (added via `addLayer()`) | **layer** (unchanged) | "GeoJSON layer", "terrain layer" |

- Do not translate "Descriptor" — use the English term as-is in all locales
- Resource layers retain the term "layer" (or "レイヤー" in Japanese)

## Link paths must be lowercase

Astro/Starlight converts directory names to lowercase slugs when generating URLs (e.g., `API/` becomes `api/`, `Resource Layer/` becomes `resource-layer/`). All link paths in markdown must use lowercase to match the generated URLs.

- `../../../three/api/feature-evaluator/` not `../../../three/API/feature-evaluator/`
- `../../../three/introduction/about-layer/` not `../../../three/Introduction/about-layer/`
- `../../../three/api/navara_three_api` not `../../../three/API/navara_three_api`
- `#elevationdecoder-type` not `#ElevationDecoder-type`

Spaces in directory names become hyphens (e.g., `Resource Layer/` → `resource-layer/`). Do not use `%20` encoding.

## Prefer alias or relative path

- Link to a page: `[Page name](../../../link/to/page)`, not `/link/to/page`.
- Link to a asset: `![Alt](@assets/image.png)`
- Import a component: `import { Button } from "@components/Button"`

### Never use `./` for a sibling page

Every page is served at a directory URL with a trailing slash (`three_default_descs/Mesh Desc/about.md` → `/three_default_descs/mesh-desc/about/`), and Astro emits markdown link hrefs verbatim. The browser therefore resolves `./sibling` *inside* the current page's own URL and 404s:

- `[ArclineMeshDesc](../arcline-mesh-desc)` — resolves to `/three_default_descs/mesh-desc/arcline-mesh-desc`
- `[ArclineMeshDesc](./arcline-mesh-desc)` — resolves to `/three_default_descs/mesh-desc/about/arcline-mesh-desc` (404)

Use `../` to reach a sibling page, `../../` to reach a sibling directory, and so on. This applies to every page, not just `about.md` index pages.
