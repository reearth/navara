# Navara Developer Documentation

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

This repository contains the developer documentation for Navara, a 3D globe map engine prototype built on Rust + WebAssembly + Three.js.

## 📚 Documentation Structure

The documentation covers three main components of the Navara ecosystem:

- **navara** - Core 3D globe map engine
- **navara_three** - Map engine for manipulating maps on the front-end side, based on Three.js
- **navara_wasm** - WebAssembly components for high-performance map rendering

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of this Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
