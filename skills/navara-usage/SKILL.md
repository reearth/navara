# Using Navara (@navaramap/three)

Navara is a 3D globe map engine: reusable GIS logic lives in a Rust/WASM core, and drawing is delegated to a swappable CG-rendering library. `@navaramap/three` is the Three.js-based binding (currently the only one; more rendering engines are planned — avoid wording that fixes Navara to Three.js in prose). Its public API is `ThreeView` plus a declarative Source/Layer/Descriptor model.

## Packages

| Package                           | What it provides                                                                                                                                                                        | When you need it                                                                      |

Most apps need only the first two.

## The canonical setup order (invariant)

```typescript
import ThreeView from "@navaramap/three";
import {
  DefaultPlugin,
  type DefaultDescriptions,
} from "@navaramap/three-default-plugin";

const view = new ThreeView<DefaultDescriptions>({ shadow: true }); // 1. construct
const defaultPlugin = new DefaultPlugin();
view.addPlugin(defaultPlugin); // 2. add ALL plugins — before init, or it throws
await view.init(); // 3. async init (WASM + workers + pipeline)
defaultPlugin.addDefaultPhotorealScene(); // 4. optional photoreal sky/sun/AA bundle
view.setCamera({
  lng: 139.77,
  lat: 35.68,
  height: 10000,
  heading: 0,
  pitch: -30,
  roll: 0,
});
const src = view.addSource({
  type: "raster-tile",
  url: "https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
  maxZoom: 18,
});
view.addLayer({ type: "raster", source: src }); // 5. sources/layers/effects after init
```

When `DefaultPlugin` is used, parameterize the view as `new ThreeView<DefaultDescriptions>` so descriptor keys are typed.

## Start from a recipe when building a scene

For "make it look good" goals, use the proven compositions in [references/recipes.md](references/recipes.md) (e.g. the photoreal base scene: DefaultPlugin + photoreal scene + Re:Earth quantized-mesh terrain + EOX satellite imagery + attribution) instead of assembling pieces from scratch.

## Four capability tiers — pick the lowest that solves the problem

1. **Declarative API** — add sources and layers with plain config objects. Covers basemaps, terrain, vector data, 3D Tiles. → [references/declarative-api.md](references/declarative-api.md)
2. **Imperative API** — per-feature evaluation (`FeatureEvaluator`), picking, terrain sampling, geodetic/ECEF math. → [references/imperative-api.md](references/imperative-api.md)
3. **Plugins** — reusable purpose-built features (photoreal scene, first-person walk, DOM overlays, attribution), and how to write your own. → [references/plugins.md](references/plugins.md)
4. **Custom descriptors** — your own meshes/effects/lights, with access to the render pipeline, depth buffer, and normal/G-buffer (MRT). → [references/custom-desc.md](references/custom-desc.md)

## Critical gotchas (apply everywhere)

- **`addPlugin()` after `init()` throws.** All plugin `init()`s run in parallel during `view.init()`.
- **Updates are partial merges:** `Layer.update()`, `Source.update()` and mesh/effect/light handle `.update()` all merge into the current config — omitted materials and omitted fields within a material are preserved (verified: `layer.update({ point: { color } })` keeps `size`/`clampToGround`). Note: `Layer.update()`'s JSDoc says "the entire configuration is replaced" — that text is outdated; trust the merge behavior shown in its own `@example`.
- **Vector materials consume only their native geometry unless `geometryTypes` opts in more.** `point`/`billboard`/`text` default to `["point"]`, `polyline` to `["line"]` — polygon data with only a `polyline` material renders nothing. Opt in with e.g. `polyline: { geometryTypes: ["line", "polygon"] }` (polygon boundary rings incl. holes render as closed polylines) or `point: { geometryTypes: ["point", "line", "polygon"] }` (one point per vertex, ring-closing duplicate skipped). The array **replaces** the default, so include the native category to keep it. Boundary polylines are at ring base height only — extruded-polygon edges remain `polygon.outline`'s job. Two caveats: (1) `geometryTypes` is construction-time config — `layer.update()` applies a new value only to tiles loaded afterwards (resident tiles keep their old geometry, and toggling back never removes already-built derivations); set it at layer creation or delete/re-add the layer. (2) On tiled paths derivation walks tile-clipped rings; boundary polylines drop clip-introduced edges automatically (draped and non-draped are both clean), but vector-tile-derived points can still appear at clip-introduced vertices near tile edges.
- **Sources are reference-counted:** `source.delete()` returns `false` while any layer still references it. Updating a source resets and reloads every referencing layer.
- **Inline GeoJSON `data` does not reload via `source.update()`** (verified 2026-08: readouts driven from the same code ran, but the rendered features never changed; URL-based sources do reload). Re-pointing the existing layer at a fresh source also failed to render. The working pattern for dynamic inline data is rebuild both: `layer.delete(); source.delete(); source = view.addSource({ type: "geojson", data }); layer = view.addLayer({...})`. For measurement-style dynamic overlays (a handful of markers + a line), mesh descs are the simpler tool: add/delete `SphereMeshDesc` markers and a `TubeMeshDesc` arc via handles — see `example/pages/examples/api/measure-geodesic`.
- **Non-draped vector polylines are lit; draped ones are unlit.** `clampToGround: false` polylines render through a lit shader (`material.lights = !isTexturized`), so with zero lights they draw **black** — invisible on a dark basemap and a classic "the line is missing" trap. Draped (`clampToGround: true`) lines bake into tile textures and ignore lights. Fix: add `view.addLight({ ambient: { intensity: 1 } })` (needs DefaultPlugin) to show the line at its plain color.
- **Polyline `width` is screen px, but clamped by `maxWidth` in world meters (default 1000).** From a whole-globe camera 1 px ≈ 11 km, so the default clamp makes any line sub-pixel — pass `maxWidth` (e.g. `100_000`) for high-altitude views. Draped polylines additionally vanish entirely at globe-scale zoom (bake resolution) regardless of `maxWidth` (verified at camera height ≈ 9,000 km; they render fine at ≈ 2,000 km) — use non-draped lines for global arcs.
- **WASM-backed math throws before `view.init()`.** `degreeToRadian`, `EllipsoidGeodesic`, `geodeticToVector3`, … call into `navara_wasm_api`, which `view.init()` initializes — a module-top-level call fails with e.g. "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'angleToRadian')". Plain lat/lng/height constants are fine at module top level (they're just degree numbers); call the WASM-backed functions on them only after init.
- **Layer render order = add order** (e.g. add terrain before the raster basemap draped on it).
- **`elevationHeatmap`: omitting `logBoundary` breaks software-GL backends.** `Math.log(mat.logBoundary)` (navara_three `mesh/tile/index.ts`) turns the missing value into a NaN uniform, and the branch-free ternary in `elevation_pars_fragment.glsl` evaluates the log path even with `logarithmic` false. ANGLE Metal flushes the NaN (renders fine); SwiftShader — i.e. headless Playwright, the screenshot pipeline, CI — propagates it and every pixel renders one constant color (verified 2026-07 on both backends with identical code). Until the engine guards that computation, pass `logBoundary` explicitly when headless captures matter. The material itself is unlit and needs no terrain layer or lights; `globe.elevationColormap` supplies the colors.
- **Deferred lighting recipe:** set `view.lit = false` so materials output albedo while the lit pipeline keeps writing normals and the shadow buffer, then re-light in a late post pass from `getNormalTexture()` + `getShadowTexture()`. A per-mesh/material `lit: true` opts something out, and the shadow buffer's G channel is the per-pixel mask for it — transparent unlit materials cannot be masked this way (they are already blended into the albedo). Toggling `lit` recompiles, so it is a config switch, not a per-frame control. Worked effect: `example/pages/debug/buffers/run.ts`; option semantics: docs `three/api/threeview-properties#lit`.
- **`aerialPerspective.irradiance: true` IS a deferred lighting pass — always pair it with `view.lit = false`.** It sets `sunLight`/`skyLight` on the `AerialPerspectiveEffect`, which re-lights the G-buffer from the precomputed atmosphere using the normal buffer. With `view.lit` left at its default `true` the scene is lit twice (forward + atmosphere) and washes out, which is what forces the unnaturally high exposures (10+) seen in older snippets; unlit + irradiance sits around 3. Verified 2026-08: the deferred pass does **not** consume the shadow G-buffer, so `sun.castShadow` cascaded shadows vanish under `lit = false` (cloud shadows survive — the effect samples those from `atmosphere.shadow`). Close-up scenes that need cast shadows or transparency keep `irradiance: false` and the default `lit`.
- **`SnowMeshDesc` / `RainMeshDesc` `maxHeight` is an opacity fade, not a spawn ceiling.** Every frame the material opacity is multiplied by `max(1 - cameraHeight / maxHeight, 0)`, so with the default `maxHeight: 3000` a camera at or above 3 km renders *zero* visible snow while everything still runs — a silent empty screenshot. Particles also spawn in an `areaWidth` x `areaHeight` box around the camera and `size` is world-space (`sizeAttenuation`), so flakes only read at their nominal size when the camera is inside the weather, not looking at it from above.
- **`sun.shadowFar` defaults to 50 km**, spreading the 4 cascades so wide that person- or car-scale shadows never resolve. For character/street-level scenes use `shadowFar: ~1000` with `shadowLambda: 1` (fully logarithmic split) — that is what makes a walking character cast a visible shadow (`example/pages/examples/plugin/person-view`).
- **Never reconstruct a G-buffer normal with `xy * 2 - 1`** — it is octahedral; decode with `unpackVec2ToNormal` from `NORMAL_PACKING_SHADER`. The wrong reconstruction looks plausible and costs a long debugging session. Known inconsistency to watch for: `instancedSprite.frag.glsl` / `sdfText.frag.glsl` define a LOCAL `xy*0.5+0.5` packer that does not match.
- **Allocating any optional G-buffer silently re-routes meshes into the MRT pass** (so their own normal/shadow/mask is written instead of the terrain's showing through). Expect the first `addEffect` that needs a buffer to recompile and to shift where meshes render. Self-shadow acne (striping) on large mesh faces in the shadow buffer is tamed with `sun: { shadowNormalBias: ~3 }`.
- **A custom effect should inherit scene config, not re-declare it** — `ctx.findLight("sun")` / `findEffect` / `findMesh` resolve active descs by registered key, so a lighting effect reads the sun's real intensity and `view.atmosphere.sunDirection` instead of growing its own options.
- **Toggling terrain on/off: delete/re-add the layer.** `terrainLayer.update({ terrain: { show: false } })` has no visible effect (verified 2026-07); `layer.delete()` drops the surface to the flat ellipsoid and draped raster layers re-drape automatically.
- **Handle events vs desc events:** mesh/light/effect handles (`BaseHandle`) only emit `deleted` — desc-specific events (`load` / `error` / `animationReady` on GLTF, instanced-GLTF and splat descs) live on the desc, so subscribe via `handle.ref.on("load", ...)`.
- **Never write to `view.camera.raw` frustum fields** (`fov` etc.) — the engine overwrites them and Rust-side culling desyncs. Use the `view.camera.fov/near/far` setters.
- **Units:** every public lat/lng API takes **degrees** — `setCamera`/`flyTo`, `geodetic`, terrain sampling, `geodeticToVector3`/`vector3ToGeodetic`, `EllipsoidGeodesic` (headings in degrees too). Mesh `position` is ECEF meters. Three.js-level angles stay **radians** (Euler `rotation` fields, `rotateAroundAxis`/`rotateAround` — that's what `degreeToRadian` is still for); batch IDs are 24-bit.
- **Ground placement needs `sampleTerrainMostDetailed`:** the synchronous `sampleTerrainHeight` reads only render-resident tiles, so from a distant camera it returns a coarse-LOD height (tens of meters off) — `await view.sampleTerrainMostDetailed(source, positions)` (source = the registered terrain source's handle or id, always explicit) fetches the source's max-LOD tiles regardless of the camera.  See [references/imperative-api.md](references/imperative-api.md).
- **Placing a mesh geographically:** use `geodetic` — `{ lng, lat, height, heading, pitch, roll, scale }` in **degrees** and metres, the same convention as `setCamera`. It builds a West-Up-North (Y-up, +Z north) frame, which matches glTF's front=+Z / up=+Y convention, so an unmodified glTF asset needs **no** `Rx(+90°)` up-axis correction. `heading` is the compass bearing the asset's front faces, and `pitch`/`roll` also cover in-frame flips — a Y-down splat capture is upright with `pitch: 180` instead of a separate `rotation` offset. Add `heightReference: "terrain"` to make `height` relative to terrain (a live subscription that re-clamps as tiles stream — for a one-shot placement, `sampleTerrainMostDetailed` is cheaper). `position`/`rotation`/`scale` stay available as offsets *inside* the frame, and `geodetic`, `matrix` and `matrixWorld` share one placement slot — setting any two of them throws `ConflictingTransformError`.
- **Low-level placement:** raw `position`/`rotation`/`scale` are earth-centered ECEF metres, so a bare `position` won't sit upright at a lng/lat. Set `matrixWorld` to a tangent-frame matrix when you need a frame `geodetic` doesn't build — `eastNorthUpToFixedFrame` (ENU, Z-up), `northEastDownToFixedFrame` (NED), `northUpEastToFixedFrame` (NUE, Y-up but +X north), `northWestUpToFixedFrame` (NWU), `westUpNorthToFixedFrame` (WUN, what `geodetic` uses). All are exported from `@navaramap/three`. Note the Z-up frames need an `Rx(+90°)` correction for glTF assets; WUN does not. See [references/imperative-api.md](references/imperative-api.md).
- **Init-only options** cannot change after `init()`: `shadow`, `maxSse`, `segments`, `useNormal`.
- **Optional G-buffers: declare, never assume.** They exist only while an active effect lists them in `static requiredBuffers`, so read them through the `ViewContext`/`MRTPassEffectDesc` getters (`undefined` when disabled) and **re-fetch every frame** — a config change rebuilds the attachments. Never hardcode an attachment index; they are packed and shift. Switching the set reallocates attachments and recompiles shaders, so add an effect once and tune via `handle.update()` rather than add/remove per frame. Only MRT-pass fragments write the G-buffer at all — a mesh sitting in the opaque/transparent scene contributes nothing to it.
- **Effect compatibility:** `hideUnderground: false` and `logarithmicDepthBuffer` break some effect descriptors — test, and prefer defaults.
- `picking: true` (constructor, default on) is required for the `featureClick` (click or touch tap) and `featureHover`/`featureEnter`/`featureLeave` (pointermove) events and pickable meshes. Hover picking activates only while a hover-family listener is registered.
- **API stability tiers:** `ThreeView` = Tier 0 (stable). `Plugin` + `ViewContext` = Tier 1 (may break between minor versions). Keep app code on Tier 0 where possible.
- **Runtime assets (atmosphere/cloud/noise/water) bundle automatically** — each file is referenced via a static `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`, so Vite/webpack emit them into the app build; no copying or config needed. To self-host instead, pass `atmosphereAssetsUrl` (Atmosphere) / `assetsUrl` (Clouds) pointing at a directory that keeps the **original filenames** (`transmittance.exr`, `local_weather.png`, …); both default to `undefined` = bundled assets. There are no directory URL constants (appending filenames to a directory can't survive bundler hashing) — only per-file constants exist (`ATMOSPHERE_TRANSMITTANCE_URL`, `CLOUD_LOCAL_WEATHER_URL`, `STBN_URL`, `WATER_NORMAL_URL`, `STARS_ASSETS_URL`, …).

## Lighting — when it's needed and which light to add

Lighting only affects surfaces that carry **normals**. Anything without normals is shaded uniformly (fullbright) and needs no light. But once normals are present, **no light means the surface renders black**. Add at least one light when you have:

- meshes / GLTF models that ship vertex normals
- `quantized-mesh` terrain loaded with `requestVertexNormals: true`
- `raster-dem` terrain rendered with a `hillshade` material
- the bare globe when the view was constructed with `useNormal: true` (init-only) — needed for the sun to shade the globe when no terrain or hillshade layer supplies normals

Built-in lights — register via `DefaultPlugin`, then `view.addLight<T>({ ... })`:

| Descriptor          | Key             | Use                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AmbientLightDesc`  | `ambient`       | flat fill — raise overall brightness or light everything uniformly; no direction, no shadows |
| `LightProbeDesc`    | `lightProbe`    | pseudo-IBL from spherical-harmonics coefficients (e.g. a baked night ambient)                |
| `SkyLightProbeDesc` | `skyLightProbe` | dynamic sky ambient that follows the sun through the atmosphere system                       |
| `SunLightDesc`      | `sun`           | directional sun; its direction is derived from `atmosphere.date`, and it casts CSM shadows   |

`addDefaultPhotorealScene()` already adds a `sun` + `skyLightProbe` — start there for realistic scenes and add `ambient`/`lightProbe` to taste.

A `sun` light also works standalone, without `addDefaultPhotorealScene()`: its direction still follows `atmosphere.date`, and its color is computed from the atmosphere transmittance texture, which loads on demand (verified 2026-08 shading quantized-mesh terrain with only `view.addLight({ sun: {} })`). Note `view.toneMappingExposure` has no visible effect in such a scene — tone mapping is inactive without the photoreal effect stack, so don't reach for exposure to fix brightness there; use the light's `intensity`.

**`atmosphere.date` is local-time-sensitive.** It's a plain JS `Date`, so `new Date("2024-06-21T12:00:00")` is read in the _device's_ timezone — the sun lands in a different place per machine. Pin a global instant with an explicit UTC string (`new Date("2024-06-21T12:00:00Z")`). To hold the same time-of-day or sun elevation while flying the camera to another country, don't recompute by hand — use `view.atmosphere.setDateFromCameraAt({ lng })` (keeps local solar time) or `setElevationFromCameraAt({ lat, lng })` (keeps sun elevation).
