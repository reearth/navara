# Navara

Web map engines have long forced a choice: engines with polished declarative APIs are easy to adopt but hard to extend beyond their built-in features, while engines that expose deep low-level control are powerful but demand steep expertise. Fully 3D map applications usually leave no option but the latter. Navara is a highly extensible 3D map engine built to remove that trade-off. It streams real-world GIS data such as satellite imagery, terrain, 3D city models, and vector data onto an interactive globe, and lets you present it the way your application needs: as a clean basemap for data visualization, styled per feature by attributes, or as a photorealistic scene with atmosphere, sunlight, and shadows.

Navara's answer to the trade-off is a tiered API. Capabilities are organized into four tiers, so you start with the simplicity of a declarative engine and drop down, as far as the render pipeline itself, only when you need more control:

- **Declarative**: declare sources and layers as plain config objects (basemaps, terrain, vector data, 3D Tiles); meshes, effects, and lights work the same declarative way.
- **Plugin**: add purpose-built features as ready-made bundles, such as the photorealistic scene, first-person walking, DOM overlays, and the attribution UI; anyone can package and share their own plugin.
- **API**: per-feature styling by attributes (`FeatureEvaluator`), feature picking, terrain sampling, camera control, and standalone geodetic/ECEF math utilities usable without the map engine.
- **Shader**: full access to the rendering engine for your own shaders and effects, writing custom mesh/effect/light descriptors against its scene graph and render pipeline.

Under the hood, Navara is a headless GIS core, independent of the rendering engine. The complex but reusable GIS logic (data parsing, geometry construction, and more) lives in Rust / WebAssembly, and drawing is delegated to libraries specialized in CG rendering, currently Three.js. Rendering is where GPU APIs and platforms vary the most, so keeping that layer swappable is what lets Navara expand to other rendering engines and platforms in the future.

## Usage

See [What is Navara?](https://navara-docs.reearth.workers.dev//guides/introduction/what-is-navara/) for an overview and [Getting Started](https://navara-docs.reearth.workers.dev//guides/introduction/getting-started/) to build your first 3D map.

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](./assets/architecture.png)

## Development

### Install toolchains

You have to install the following environment.

- Rust (stable)
- Node.js (LTS)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Install prerequisites

```console
cargo install cargo-make
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.126
rustup component add rust-src
```
Optional: Install binaryen for `wasm-opt` optimization: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen

`rust-src` is required by release WASM builds, which rebuild std with `-Z build-std` for smaller binaries.

### Initial setup

You need to run this command first time.

```console
cargo make prepare
```

### Run with hot-reload

```console
cargo make dev
```

> An error is displayed in the Web browser, but this is because the compilation of WASM has not been completed. Wait a little and when the compilation of WASM is completed, reload the page and it will be displayed correctly.


Alternatively, use `web` if you are working on the web side (using release rust builds + debug web builds)
```console
cargo make web
```

### Screenshots

Please take a screenshot when you add/update an example in `navara_three/example`.

```sh
pnpm navara_three screenshots {PAGE_NAME}
```

## API Document

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for details.

```console
pnpm dev:docs      # Start dev server
pnpm build:docs    # Build for production
pnpm preview:docs  # Preview production build
```
