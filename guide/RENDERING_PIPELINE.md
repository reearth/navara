# Rendering Pipeline

How a Navara frame is rendered on the TypeScript side (`web/navara_three`): the
pass pipeline, the MRT G-buffer, its encodings and invariants, and how meshes,
materials, and effects plug into it. Read this before touching
`CustomRenderPass`, `gbufferLayout`, `overrideMaterialsForMRT`, the enhancer
shaders, or anything that samples a G-buffer texture.

Single sources of truth referenced throughout:

- `web/navara_three/src/material/gbufferLayout.ts` — TS side of the G-buffer
  layout (attachment indices, defines, write snippets, allocation).
- `shaders/glsl/chunks/gbuffer_pars_fragment.glsl` — GLSL side (output
  declarations, write macros). The two must stay in sync; a layout change is
  designed to be an edit to these two files only.

## 1. Frame overview

Rendering is a [postprocessing](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing)
`EffectComposer` pipeline. Every pass is owned by an `EffectDesc` (built-in or
plugin/user-registered) and ordered declaratively via the descs' static
`insertAfter` / `insertBefore` keys — there is no hardcoded pass list. The
built-ins registered by `ThreeView` are:

| key | pass | role |
|---|---|---|
| `skyEnvMap` | `SkyEnvMapPass` | renders the sky to a cube map for reflections (before `mrt`) |
| `mrt` | `CustomRenderPass` | the G-buffer pass — everything in section 2 |
| `transparent` | transparent-scene pass | renders the `transparent` scene after atmosphere-type effects |
| `final` | `FinalCopyEffectDesc` | copies the result out |

`DefaultPlugin` inserts its effects (aerial perspective, clouds, SSAO, SSR,
selective bloom/outline, tone mapping, SMAA/FXAA, …) into the same ordering
graph. A typical resolved order:

```
SkyEnvMapPass → CustomRenderPass(mrt) → selective effects → transparent
→ aerial perspective / lens flare … → tone mapping → SMAA/FXAA → copy
```

Custom effects that read G-buffer textures should insert **late**
(`insertBefore: ["toneMapping", "smaa", "fxaa", "final"]`) so every earlier
pass has already composited into the input buffer they read.

## 2. Scenes and pass routing

`Scenes` (`src/scene.ts`) splits renderables by pipeline role:

| scene | rendered by | writes G-buffer? |
|---|---|---|
| `globe` | `CustomRenderPass` | **yes** — terrain/basemap tiles |
| `mrt` | `CustomRenderPass` | **yes** — meshes participating in the G-buffer |
| `draped` | `CustomRenderPass` (stencil draping) | **yes** |
| `opaque` | `CustomRenderPass`, but *after* the G-buffer copy | no — composer input only |
| `transparent` | the `transparent` pass, after atmosphere effects | no |
| `light` | added temporarily to whichever scene is being lit-rendered | — |
| `skyEnvMap` | `SkyEnvMapPass` | no |

A mesh desc chooses its scene via `MeshDesc.getPassKey()` (default
`"opaque"`). `MeshDescWithSelectiveEffect` overrides it: SE-capable meshes go
to `"mrt"` when **either** a selective effect is registered
(`selectiveEffectRegistry.slotCount > 0`) **or** any optional G-buffer is
allocated (`view.buffers`). The second condition matters: a mesh outside the
MRT pass leaves the G-buffer holding whatever is *behind* it, so
buffer-reading effects (deferred lighting, SSAO, …) would shade "through" the
mesh. Placement is re-evaluated on the `effectSlotsChanged` and
`gbufferChanged` ViewContext events.

`opaque`/`transparent` scene content is deliberately outside the G-buffer
(cheap path for meshes that don't need it); be aware their pixels contribute
nothing to any G-buffer attachment.

## 3. `CustomRenderPass` — the MRT pass

Per frame, in order:

1. **Shadow maps** — `globe + mrt + opaque` are gathered into a temporary
   `shadowScene` and rendered to a dummy target with
   `renderer.shadowMap.needsUpdate = true`, so CSM shadow maps include casters
   from all three scenes.
2. **G-buffer defines stamping** — see section 5. Gated by O(1) change
   signals; the scene traversal does not run on quiet frames.
3. **Globe** — rendered into `gbufferRenderTarget` (with the `light` group
   temporarily attached). Globe-only normal and depth are then copied out
   (`globeNormalCopyPass`, `globeDepthCopyPass`) for effects that need
   terrain-only data (e.g. clamped-polygon normals).
4. **Underground / transparency handling** — depending on
   `globe.hideUnderground` / `globe.transparent`, depth is cleared and the
   globe+mrt scenes may be re-rendered together (`combinedScene`) so blending
   against the globe works; draped meshes render via stencil testing in
   between.
5. **MRT scene** — meshes render into the G-buffer (blended meshes included —
   see the A-channel invariant below).
6. **Copy** — `RenderTargetCopyPass` copies G-buffer color (+ depth via
   `gl_FragDepth`) into the composer's input buffer.
7. **Opaque scene** — rendered directly into the composer input (no G-buffer
   writes), then the combined depth is copied for downstream effects
   (`allDepthCopyPass`).

The pass owns `gbufferRenderTarget` (cloned from the composer input, plus a
`DepthTexture` with stencil). Its `textureIndex` property maps buffer names to
attachment indices for the current configuration.

## 4. The G-buffer

### Layout

Attachment indices are **dynamic and packed** — three.js cannot express sparse
MRT attachments, so enabled buffers are packed in a fixed order with no gaps
and no placeholder textures:

| attachment | content | type | when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 `color` | forward color (or albedo — see `lit`) | HalfFloat | always |
| 1 `normal` | RG = octahedral view-space normal, B = metalness/reflectivity, A = roughness *(and blend factor!)* | HalfFloat | always |
| packed next | `effectIds` — R = selective-effect bitmask | HalfFloat, Nearest | `buffers.selectiveEffect` |
| packed next | `emissive` — RGB = HDR emissive | HalfFloat | `buffers.emissive` |
| packed next | `shadow` — R = shadow amount (0 = lit .. 1 = shadowed), G = albedo-output flag | UnsignedByte | `buffers.shadow` |

Because indices shift, shader `layout(location = …)` values are delivered per
material as defines (`GBUFFER_EFFECT_ID_LOCATION` etc.,
`computeGBufferDefines`). **Never hardcode an optional attachment index** —
read `CustomRenderPass.textureIndex`, the `MRTPassEffectDesc` getters, or the
`ViewContext` accessors (`getNormalTexture`, `getEffectIdsTexture`,
`getEmissiveTexture`, `getShadowTexture`), which return `undefined` for
disabled buffers. Fetch them **every frame** — a configuration change rebuilds
the render target with new texture objects.

### Derived configuration

There is no user-facing buffers option. The configuration is the **union of
active effects' `static requiredBuffers`** (`selectiveBloom` →
`["selectiveEffect", "emissive"]`, `selectiveOutline` → `["selectiveEffect"]`;
`shadow` has no built-in consumer and is enabled by custom effects).
`ThreeView._syncGBuffers()` re-derives on `addEffect` and on handle deletion
and pushes the result to `CustomRenderPass.setBuffers()`, which rebuilds the
render target **as a fresh object** (reconfiguring a live target in place
leaves the renderer's cached GL state sampling a texture the framebuffer no
longer writes) while keeping the color/normal/depth `Texture` identities
(effects like SSR capture those references at creation). `addEffect` throws if
the prospective attachment count would exceed the device's
`gl.MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS`.

A configuration change reallocates attachments and recompiles shaders — add
effects once and tune them via `update()`, don't add/remove per frame.

### Encodings

- **Normals are octahedral-encoded** (signed, from
  `@takram/three-geospatial`'s packing). Decode with `unpackVec2ToNormal()`;
  the GLSL is exported as `NORMAL_PACKING_SHADER`. A naive `xy * 2 - 1`
  reconstruction produces wrong shading. (Known inconsistency: the raw
  sprite/text shaders use a local `xy * 0.5 + 0.5` packing.)
- **Depth** follows three.js packing conventions — check
  `depthBufferPacking` / `globeDepthBufferPacking` on the MRT desc and use the
  helpers in `DEPTH_PACKING_SHADER` (three's `packing` chunk).
- **Shadow buffer G channel** is the albedo-output flag (see `lit` below) — a
  deferred lighting pass uses it as its "shade this pixel" mask.

### The alpha-channel blending invariant

Selective-effect-capable meshes render into the G-buffer **even when
`transparent: true`** (for depth consistency), and WebGL2 blends *each*
attachment with **that attachment's own output alpha**. Therefore, on every
attachment, A is the blend factor, not a data channel:

- `effectIds` / `emissive` / `shadow`: selective writes use A = 1.0 ("replace
  what's behind"), non-selective writes use A = 0.0 ("keep what's behind").
  One attachment can carry at most three data channels (RGB). This is why
  emissive could not be merged into the effectIds attachment.
- `normal`: A carries roughness *data*, which historically violated the
  invariant — a blended material with low roughness would keep (and leak) the
  normal of whatever lies behind it. Handled by `GBUFFER_NORMAL_ALPHA()`:
  materials stamped `NVR_BLENDED` (from `material.transparent`) write A = 1.0;
  the non-`USE_ROUGHNESS` fallback is 1.0 (fully rough — physically correct
  for diffuse). When adding a normal write, always route the alpha through
  `GBUFFER_NORMAL_ALPHA()`, never a raw constant 0.0.

All G-buffer writes go through the `GBUFFER_WRITE_*` macros from the pars
chunk — never assign `effectIdBuffer` / `emissiveBuffer` / `shadowBuffer`
directly. Disabled buffers compile the macros to nothing, so write sites stay
unconditional. `gbufferLayout.test.ts` enforces macro/branch parity.

## 5. Define stamping

Materials can come from anywhere (built-ins, enhancers, user
`ShaderMaterial`s), so per-desc wiring of G-buffer defines is impossible to
keep complete. Instead `CustomRenderPass.stampGBufferDefines()` traverses the
scenes and stamps every material it finds. Two scene sets, two define sets:

| Scenes | Stamped defines |
| --- | --- |
| `globe`, `mrt`, `draped` (G-buffer) | buffer enable/location (`USE_GBUFFER_*`, `*_LOCATION`), blended flag (`NVR_BLENDED`, synced from `material.transparent` on every visit), scene-level lit default (`NVR_UNLIT_SCENE`) |
| `opaque`, `transparent` (forward-only) | scene-level lit default (`NVR_UNLIT_SCENE`) only |

`NVR_UNLIT_SCENE` is a *lighting* define, not a G-buffer one, so it must reach
the forward-only scenes too — a mesh sits there whenever no selective effect
and no optional buffer routes it to the MRT pass (see section 2), and
`view.lit` has to apply to it all the same. The G-buffer defines must **not**
be stamped there: those materials would declare outputs the single-attachment
target has no room for. The two sets are tracked by separate `WeakSet`s, so a
material first visited in `opaque` still receives the G-buffer defines when it
later moves to `mrt`.

Stale defines are set to `false` (three's sanctioned "absent" value — never
`delete`). Changes flip `material.needsUpdate`, and three includes
`material.defines` in the program cache key, so recompiles happen exactly when
needed.

The traversal itself is **lazy** (`shouldStampGBufferDefines`): it only runs
when an O(1) signal fires —

1. explicit dirty flag (construction, `setBuffers`, `setLit`),
2. a top-level `children.length` change on any of the five stamped scenes,
3. a change in `renderer.info.programs.length` — a material must compile
   before it can render, so even a deeply-nested async addition (a glTF
   populating a scene-resident group) or a `transparent` flip that triggers a
   recompile is caught one frame later; the system converges within a frame.

Steady-state cost is a handful of integer compares per frame.

## 6. Material patching

- `overrideMaterialsForMRT()` (run at `ThreeView` construction, idempotent)
  patches every three.js `ShaderLib` entry so **all built-in materials** write
  the G-buffer: it injects the pars chunk, the normal/effect/shadow writes at
  the end of `main()`, and the albedo-output override just before
  `#include <opaque_fragment>`.
- Custom `ShaderMaterial` / `LineMaterial` bypass `ShaderLib` and opt in via
  `setupMaterialForMRT(material, { normal })`.
- Raw `.glsl` shaders (`polyline`, `instancedSprite`, `sdfText`, tile chunks)
  include `chunks/gbuffer_pars_fragment.glsl` directly and call the same
  macros.
- The enhancers (polygon/model/polyline/…) and the tile mesh locate injected
  code by **exact string match** on the exported snippets
  (`GBUFFER_NORMAL_WRITE_*`, `GBUFFER_EFFECT_WRITE_BUILTIN`, …). Changing a
  snippet requires updating every replacement string in lockstep — this is why
  the snippets live in `gbufferLayout.ts` as shared constants.

### `onBeforeCompile` ordering

Several systems wrap `material.onBeforeCompile`, and **they compete for the
same anchors**. `navara_three_csm` replaces `#include <lights_fragment_begin>`
with its cascaded-lights chunk (`createFragmentShader.ts`), so a handler that
delegates to the previous one *before* looking for that anchor finds nothing
and silently does nothing — no error, no warning, just unlit-looking output.

When wrapping `onBeforeCompile`, do your own replacement **first**, then
delegate, and keep the anchor line in your output so the next handler can still
find it. `setupMaterialForDrape` does exactly this; `DrapedMesh.test.ts` pins
the ordering.

## 7. Draping (`DrapedMesh`)

`DrapedMesh.process()` paints a volume onto the terrain with a three-pass
stencil test (depth-fail counting, then a final pass with
`stencilFunc = NotEqual`, `side = BackSide`, `depthTest = false`).

The consequence that governs everything else: **the final pass has no depth
test, so one pixel can be covered by several back faces** where the volume
folds over a peak or the shape is non-convex. Every one of them is drawn, and
the last wins. The drape therefore only looks like a flat decal while its
shading is a pure function of screen position:

- **Normal** — `setupMaterialForDrape` (in `mesh/DrapedMesh.ts`) swaps in the
  terrain normal, sampled from the globe-normal copy at `gl_FragCoord`. The
  mesh's own back-face normals describe the volume, not the ground.
- **Shadows** — forced off (`receiveShadow` is an own accessor on `DrapedMesh`
  that reports `false` while draped). The shadow lookup is driven by a
  world-position varying, which is the one lighting input that still differs
  between overlapping faces.

Anything else world-position dependent reintroduces the artefact: point/spot
lights, an `envMap`, or three's `fog` (unused here — atmospheric haze is the
screen-space `aerialPerspective` effect, which is per-pixel and therefore
safe).

The globe-normal copy is produced by `globeNormalCopyPass` right after the
globe render and before `_renderDrapedMesh`, so the ordering already works. It
is kept at 1x1 unless a draped mesh exists or an effect declares
`requiredBuffers: ["globeNormal"]`.

## 8. The `lit` system (deferred-lighting groundwork)

Three-state lighting control, resolved per material by defines:

- `view.lit = false` — scene default: every material outputs **plain albedo**
  (`NVR_UNLIT_SCENE`, stamped) while the lit pipeline still runs, so normals
  and the shadow buffer keep being written. That combination — albedo in
  color, shadow amount + albedo-mask in the shadow buffer, octahedral normals
  — is exactly the input a deferred lighting pass needs.
- material/mesh `lit: true` forces the lit path (`NVR_LIT`), `lit: false`
  forces albedo (`NVR_UNLIT`), `undefined` follows the view. The option lives
  on layer materials (terrain/rasterTile/polygon/model/polyline; Rust side is
  `Option<bool>` end-to-end so "unset" survives merging) and top-level on mesh
  configs (applied by the `MeshDesc` base via `applyLit()`). On mesh updates
  the *presence* of the key decides, not its value — `update({ lit: undefined })`
  resets a mesh to inheriting `view.lit`.
- Shader resolution:
  `#if !defined(NVR_LIT) && (defined(NVR_UNLIT) || defined(NVR_UNLIT_SCENE))`
  → `outgoingLight = diffuseColor.rgb`.

A working minimal deferred-lighting effect (albedo × Lambert × shadow-buffer
shadows, sun/ambient inherited via `ctx.findLight("sun"/"ambient")` and
`view.atmosphere.sunDirection` transformed to view space) lives in
`web/navara_three/example/pages/debug/buffers/run.ts`, together with toggles
for every optional buffer — use that page (`/debug-buffers`) to integration
test pipeline changes. Shadow acne on large mesh faces is tamed with
`sun: { shadowNormalBias: ~3 }`.

## 9. Reading the G-buffer from effects

Custom `EffectDesc`s declare what they need via `static requiredBuffers`, then
read per frame:

```ts
class MyEffectDesc extends EffectDesc<...> {
  static insertBefore = ["toneMapping", "smaa", "fxaa", "final"];
  static requiredBuffers: readonly GBufferName[] = ["shadow"];

  update = () => {
    // Re-fetch every frame — never cache at pass creation.
    const normal = this.ctx.getNormalTexture();
    const shadow = this.ctx.getShadowTexture();
    ...
  };
}
```

`ViewContext.findEffect/findLight/findMesh(key)` resolve active descriptors by
registered key (e.g. inherit the sun's intensity/direction);
`_getEffects/_getLights/_getMeshes` iterate them all.
